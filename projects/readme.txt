# Projects Management System

This system allows you to automatically add projects by simply creating folders with images and text files.

## How to Add New Projects

1. **Create a project folder** in the `projects-data/` directory: projects-data/project7/

2. **Add your project image** (any name, but make it descriptive): projects-data/project7/design.jpg

3. **Create an info.txt file** with this format: Project Title|Project description goes here...|category1,category2|tag1,tag2,tag3|Month YYYY|Project Type

Example: Solar Powered Vehicle|Designed and built a solar-powered vehicle for efficiency competition...|prototype,research|Solar,Vehicle Design,Prototyping|Feb 2024|Prototype
